Installation Instructions
*************************

Binary installation
===================

Windows
-------
There exists a (graphical) Windows installer that can be downloaded from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qfsm. The installation should be straightforward and doesn't require any other software to be installed.


Linux
-----
An RPM package is provided for openSUSE on http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qfsm. RPM packages for other Linux distributions might be provided on other websites.


Mac OS X
--------
Binary packages for Mac OS X may be provided by third-party websites, like
http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Math-Scientific/Qfms.shtml.




Installing from source code
===========================


Qfsm has to be compiled using the CMake buildsystem. 


Requirements
------------
- CMake, version 2.8 or higher (http://www.cmake.org)
- Qt SDK, version 4.8 or higher (http://qt.nokia.com)
- graphviz, version 2.38 or higher (http://graphviz.org)


See the documentation of these tools/libraries for an explanation how to install them.



Building under GNU Linux/Unix
-----------------------------

Install the above-mentioned required software. If you install them via a package manager make sure you install the development packages (...-dev or ...-devel).

Unpack the source code into the current directory

  tar xvfz qfsm-0.54.0-Source.tar.gz --directory . 

and change to that directory.

Before invoking CMake you have to make sure that the program qmake is in your global PATH environment variable.
The location of qmake depends on your operating system or Linux distribution. On openSUSE for example it is under: /usr/lib/qt4/bin/
Thus, if you are using bash, you would have to type:

  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

Type:

  cmake .

Then:

  make

Finally, install Qfsm (as root):

  make install

This will install the executable "qfsm" to /usr/bin/ and the documentation to /usr/share/doc/qfsm/.

If CMake fails to find any of the dependencies but you know you have the
development headers/libraries installed, add -DLIBRARY_SEARCH_DIRS=<path/to/lib>
and -DINCLUDE_SEARCH_DIRS=<path/to/include> to the cmake command.

If you want to create a project file for your IDE (e.g. KDevelop), add
-GKDevelop3 to the cmake command above. This will create a .kdevelop file in
the build directory which can be opened by KDevelop.



Building under Windows
----------------------

In order to build Qfsm under Windows you have to execute the program CMakeSetup, specify input (source) and output directory and click on "Configure". 
You may choose between different development environments (e.g. Visual Studio) and CMake will create the respective project files.
You can then compile Qfsm as usual with your preferred build tool.
For more details, refer to the CMake documentation: http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html.

Compiling with Graphviz support:
- download the binary graphviz package from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php.
- unpack and copy the contents of the release folder to something like "C:\graphviz" 
- if you copy it to another folder change the paths in graphviz_INCLUDE_DIRS and graphviz_LIBRARY_DIRS in CMakeLists.txt accordingly
- run cmake
- compile
